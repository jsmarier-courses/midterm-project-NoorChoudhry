## Midterm Project: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Summary
This project analyzed service requests from Ottawa in August 2024 to identify community needs across different wards. After analyzing the data, using data cleaning techniques such as VIMO analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis, I discovered that wards 12 and 14 experienced the highest volumes of requests, indicating a need for additional attention and resources allocated in these areas. This analysis highlights the service demands in Ottawa and provides a framework for understanding community needs at the municipal level.
